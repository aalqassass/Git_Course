**Contributors:** ✅ @mention all contributors associated with the RFC.

## 📖 Description

✅ Provide a clear description of the component or feature and its general functionality.

### ✏️ Additional Notes (Optional)

✅ All notes that help other contributors understand the reasons for adding, deleting, or changing a specific feature should be mentioned (like [Gemini Decision Records](https://avivgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADS/pages/533909731/GDR+Gemini+Decision+Records)).

## ✍️ Requirements

-   ✅ Clearly define the problem or need that the RFC aims to address.
-   ✅ Ensure that the problem aligns with project goals and objectives.
-   ✅ Provide detailed design considerations for React components or features.
-   ✅ Consider usability, accessibility, and responsiveness in the design.

### ♿️ Accessibility

-   ✅ Ensure that the React components or features adhere to accessibility standards.
-   ✅ Research any pre-existing patterns and document the findings (e.g. https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

## 🎯 Proposal

### 👪 Component Relation (Optional)

-   ✅ Consider the reusability and maintainability aspects of React components.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Types & Usage

-   ✅ Determine the approach for types and state management (e.g., local state, Context API).
